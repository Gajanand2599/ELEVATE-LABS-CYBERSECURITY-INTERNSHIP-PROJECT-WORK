# 🔍 Network Port Scanning Project

This project was completed as part of my cybersecurity internship at Elevate Labs.

## 📌 Summary

I performed a local network reconnaissance using **Nmap** to identify active devices and open ports. This included discovering IP addresses, scanning for services, and analyzing potential security risks.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Nmap** for scanning
- **Windows OS** environment
- Basic network commands (`ipconfig`)

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Hands-on experience with TCP SYN scanning
- Identifying and analyzing exposed services
- Understanding how open ports can lead to vulnerabilities

## ✅ Outcome

The project helped me strengthen foundational cybersecurity skills, especially in network scanning and risk assessment.
